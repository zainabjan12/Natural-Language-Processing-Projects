# British Airline Reviews Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to a comprehensive analysis of British airline reviews, conducted using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. This README provides an overview of the project's objectives, methodology, and resources for further exploration.

## Project Overview

The project encompassed a series of essential steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** We initiated the project by rigorously cleaning the raw dataset. Our data preparation involved eliminating duplicates, addressing missing values, and standardizing text data to ensure it was conducive to meaningful analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:** To extract actionable insights, we engineered new features from the dataset. These augmented features played a pivotal role in categorizing and summarizing customer feedback effectively.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In this phase, we embarked on an in-depth exploration of the data. EDA was instrumental in identifying patterns, trends, and valuable insights within the dataset. It served as the foundation for understanding the nature of the reviews and identifying areas for improvement within the airline industry.

4. **NLP Techniques:** Leveraging cutting-edge NLP techniques, we extracted valuable information from customer reviews. This advanced analysis provided deeper insights into customer sentiments, preferences, and pain points.
